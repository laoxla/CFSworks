<p class="description">I was born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria. I came to the States in 2002, and I have been here ever since; I held a couple of jobs before attending college, I graduated in 2008 with an associate degree in Respiratory care and I have worked as a practitioner ever since. Now I am pursueing something I have always wanted to do but never had the courage to, until now. To be a computer programmer, I had always believed you have to have some special gift as a child, I didn't think it was a skill one could learn and develop. Well! not until now. </p>
